      <p class="text-gray-700 text-base">Eutelsat 7C is based on an all-electric propulsion version of the SSL-1300 satellite platform. Equipped with 44 operational Ku-band transponders, the new satellite will be copositioned with Eutelsat 7B, releasing Eutelsat 7A to another orbital location. This improved two-satellite constellation will enable Eutelsat to optimise resources across both satellites, with enhanced coverage flexibility and connectivity set to take the 7° East neighbourhood to a new level. By almost doubling capacity over Sub-Saharan Africa, from 22 to 42 transponders, it will also make room for several hundred additional digital channels to support the region’s fast expanding TV market. Eutelsat 7C will also be equipped with a beam providing enhanced capacity for government services over Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia, and a beam that can be steered to cover any region visible from 7° East.\n\nDirecTV is based on Astrium’s Eurostar-3000 platform. The satellite has a payload comprising of high power transponders in Ku-band and transponders in Ka-band. It will operate from 100.85° West.</p>
